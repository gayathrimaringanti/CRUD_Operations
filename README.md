# Book Vault

The Book Vault is a web application built using the Python Flask framework that allows users to manage a collection of books. It performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage book details such as the book's name, author, price, and other relevant information.

This project provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing book details, making it ideal for small-scale book inventory systems or personal book collections. It also serves as a great example of how to use Flask to build dynamic web applications.
